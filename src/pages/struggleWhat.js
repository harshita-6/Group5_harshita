                  Sexuality is an important part of who we are as humans. Beyond
                  the ability to reproduce, sexuality also defines how we see
                  ourselves and how we physically relate to others. So, what
                  exactly is meant by the term “sexual orientation”? Well, it
                  refers to a person's pattern of emotional, romantic, and
                  sexual attraction to people of a particular gender (male or
                  female). It is usually divided into 5 categories:
                  <ul>
                    • Heterosexual: Attracted to people of the opposite sex
                  </ul>
                  <ul>• Bisexual: Attracted to people of either sex</ul>
                  <ul>• Homosexual: Attracted to people of one's own sex</ul>
                  <ul>
                    • Pansexual: Attracted to people of any gender identity
                  </ul>
                  <ul>• Asexual: Not sexually attracted to other people</ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s not completely known why someone might be lesbian, gay,
                  straight or bisexual. Most scientists agree that sexual
                  orientation is the result of a combination of environmental,
                  emotional, hormonal, and biological factors. In other words,
                  many things contribute to a person's sexual orientation, and
                  the factors may be different for different people. People
                  don’t decide who they’re attracted to, and therapy, treatment,
                  or persuasion won’t change a person’s sexual orientation.
                  Homosexuality and bisexuality aren’t caused by the way
                  children were reared by their parents, or by something that
                  happened to them when they were young. You can’t turn a person
                  gay. For example, exposing a boy to toys traditionally made
                  for girls, such as dolls, won’t cause him to be gay, and
                  vice-versa. Remember, being homosexual or bisexual does not
                  mean the person is mentally ill or abnormal in any way. They
                  may face burdens caused by other people’s prejudices or
                  misunderstandings. Many people discover their sexual
                  orientation as teens or young adults, and in many cases
                  without any sexual experience. Although sexual orientation is
                  usually set early in life, it isn’t at all uncommon for your
                  desires and attractions to shift throughout your life. This is
                  called fluidity. Many people, including sex researchers and
                  scientists, believe that sexual orientation is like a scale
                  with entirely gay at one end and entirely straight on other.
                  Lots of people won’t be on the far end but somewhere in the
                  middle. Some people who are homosexual or bisexual may hide
                  their sexual orientation to avoid prejudice from others or
                  shame they may have been taught to feel about their sexuality
                  but it isn’t a choice and can’t be changed. Trying to change
                  someone to a heterosexual orientation, including so-called
                  conversion therapy, doesn’t work and can be damaging. Experts
                  don’t recommend this and it’s called “clinically and ethically
                  inappropriate.” We do not have an accurate number on how many
                  people are LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender,
                  Queer/Questioning). This is because gender identity, sexual
                  orientation, sexual identity and sexual behaviour are
                  complicated for people. So, let’s break it down:
                  <ul>
                    • Gender identity is who you feel you are inside and how you
                    express those feelings through how you act, talk, dress,
                    etc.
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                    • Sexual attraction is the romantic or sexual feelings you
                    have toward others.
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                    • Sexual identity is how you label yourself (for example,
                    using labels such as queer, gay, lesbian, straight, or
                    bisexual).
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                    • Sexual behaviour is who you have coitus with and what kind
                    of intimacy you like to have.
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  But things don’t always line up. LGBTQ can provoke fear and
                  discrimination, and not everyone is comfortable coming out.
                  So, it’s difficult to measure how many people are LGBTQ when
                  sexual orientation and gender are so complex for so many
                  people. And not everyone feels safe and comfortable with
                  coming out. Now, what is coming out? It refers to the process
                  that people who are LGBTQ go through as they work to accept
                  their sexual orientation or gender identity and share that
                  identity openly with other people. Coming out is a very brave
                  thing to do, and it’s extremely personal and different for
                  everyone. Your emotions when coming out may range from scared
                  and anxious to elated and relieved. There’s no one right way
                  to come out. It can feel better to be open and honest about
                  your sexual orientation than to hide it, but there are many
                  factors to consider before coming out. Coming out is a
                  process. Often the first step is coming out to yourself. This
                  happens as you recognize your sexual orientation and begin to
                  accept it. Next, you might choose to tell your family,
                  friends, and people in your community — sometimes right away,
                  and sometimes later. You might decide to be open with some
                  people in your life, but not with others. Coming out isn’t a
                  one-time thing. Because many people assume that everyone, they
                  meet is straight, coming out is a constant process. Every time
                  an LGBTQ-identified person meets someone new (friends,
                  co-workers, nurses and doctors, etc.), they have to decide if,
                  when, and how to come out. Choosing to come out depends on the
                  situation. The coming-out process can be freeing and can bring
                  you closer to the people you love. But it can also be
                  stressful or even risky or dangerous. You may feel safer not
                  coming out in certain situations. You don’t have to be out
                  everywhere, all the time. You can decide what’s best for you.
                  Coming out can have benefits and risks. If you’re wondering
                  whether to come out, there's a lot to consider. Does coming
                  out mean that you risk losing emotional or financial support
                  from your family? Could coming out put you in physical danger?
                  Will your family try to pressure you into being someone you’re
                  not? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you may
                  want to wait until you’re in a different situation or have
                  more support. You, and only you, are in charge of your coming
                  out experience. It's up to you to choose how, where, when, and
                  with whom to be open about your sexual orientation (and gender
                  identity). It may feel safer to start by being open with other
                  people who also identify as LGBTQ. This could be online, in
                  community centres, at an LGBTQ club or group, or with a few
                  close friends. The Internet is very useful in finding
                  communities and support in coming out.

                  Discrimination is rooted in every nook and cranny of our
                  society. So, what is homophobia?
                </p>
                <p>
                  The homophobia definition is the fear, hatred, discomfort
                  with, or mistrust of people who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual.
                  Biphobia is fear, hatred, discomfort, or mistrust,
                  specifically of people who are bisexual. Similarly,
                  transphobia is fear, hatred, discomfort with, or mistrust of
                  people who are transgender, genderqueer, or don’t follow
                  traditional gender norms. Homophobia can take many different
                  forms, including negative attitudes and beliefs about,
                  aversion to, or prejudice against bisexual, lesbian, and gay
                  people. It’s often based in irrational fear and
                  misunderstanding. Some people’s homophobia may be rooted in
                  conservative religious beliefs. People may hold homophobic
                  beliefs if they were taught them by parents and families.
                  Homophobic people may use mean language and name-calling when
                  they talk about lesbian and gay people. Biphobic people may
                  tell bisexual people that it’s “just for attention,” or that
                  they’re inherently cheaters. In its most extreme forms,
                  homophobia and biphobia can cause people to bully, abuse, and
                  inflict violence on lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. Some
                  LGBTQ people experience discrimination based on their sexual
                  orientation or gender identity. This may be discrimination
                  from religious institutions, companies, or from our
                  government. Examples include same-sex couples not being
                  allowed to marry, getting legally fired just for being LGBTQ,
                  or not being allowed into certain housing. LGBTQ people and
                  their allies have fought for equal rights and continue to do
                  so, especially concerning marriage, employment, housing and
                  health care equality, and protection from hate crimes
                  (violence against LGBTQ people because of who they are).
                  People who experience homophobic, biphobic, or transphobic
                  harassment often feel alone and are afraid to tell anyone
                  what’s happening. You should never have to face harassment.
                  You can get support from:
                  <ul>• Other LGBTQ people</ul>
                  <ul>• Your local LGBTQ community centre</ul>
                  <ul>• Online communities of LGBTQ people</ul>
                  <ul>
                    • Q Chat Space is a way for LGBTQ+ teens to connect with
                    each other through live-chat group discussions — no matter
                    where they are
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                    • Trusted LGBTQ adults that you may already know, such as
                    family members or teachers
                  </ul>
                  <ul>• Straight people who are allies to LGBTQ people</ul>
                  <ul>
                    • A Gay/Straight Alliance at your high school, if
                    applicable.
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not everyone lives in a place that has a Gay/Straight Alliance
                  in their high school, or an LGBTQ community centre. In this
                  situation, the Internet is super useful in finding communities
                  and support in dealing with homophobia and discrimination. If
                  you’re a young person who’s experiencing harassment in school,
                  it’s important to tell someone, even if that seems scary. If
                  you don’t seek help and just accept it, the harassment will
                  probably continue, or maybe even get worse over time. This can
                  make it hard to keep up with grades, activities, and school in
                  general. Some schools may have an anti-bullying and harassment
                  policy, and some states have adopted a Safe Schools Law, which
                  means that your school administrators are legally required to
                  stop the harassment. If possible, find a trusted teacher or
                  adult who is an ally to LGBTQ students and ask for their help.
                  No one has the right to discriminate against or bully another
                  person, or to hurt them emotionally or physically. So, stand
                  up for you and for the people you love and for the people who
                  need you and for the kind of world you want to live in. So,
                  stand up.
