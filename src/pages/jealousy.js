                The lie goes something like this: When someone else succeeds, it
                means I have failed. This is called a “zero-sum game.” When one
                person wins, another person loses. A positive balance in
                someone’s ledger means a negative balance in mine. But, it’s a
                myth.{" "}

                If you’re alive and breathing, you have struggled with jealousy.
                It’s part of the human condition. So, let me say that you are
                not a bad person. We have all been there at some point. We've
                seen someone who makes us feel like we aren't enough. We let
                that feeling overcome us. We obsess over someone who seems
                better. When we see others who are more successful, or who have
                something we want, it’s difficult not to feel jealous. The
                question foremost in our minds is, “Why do they have ______, and
                I don’t?” (Fill in the blank with success, fame, money, or a
                million other things.)
              </h3>
              <h3 className="display-7 fw-bold ">
                {" "}
                But this is the wrong question, and here’s why: It’s based on a
                destructive lie about success and everything else you desire.
              </h3>
              <h3 className="display-7 fw-bold ">
                {" "}
                Just like every other person, I have gone through this phase too
                but when the realization hit me, I understood that there is
                literally no connection between me and the other person’s
                success in any field of his/her life. The invisible walls
                weren’t real. They only existed in my mind, and there was
                nothing—and no one—standing in the way of the things I desire.
                It’s important to realize that resentment and jealousy doesn't
                change the heart of others-- it only changes yours. And it’s not
                good now, nor will it be ever.
              </h3>
              <h3 className="display-7 fw-bold ">
                The issue is that most of us are stuck in a poverty mentality-
                —the type of thinking that goes: “There’s only so much to go
                around. You must horde everything for yourself.” But it’s now
                time to reverse that and believe that, “There is more than
                enough to go around. Success breeds success. We can help each
                other.”
              </h3>
              <h3 className="display-7 fw-bold ">
                {" "}
                The secret is to shift your vocabulary and begin asking the
                right questions in order to move away from a blame and victim
                mentality. The only way to create the success and change you
                desire is to take 100% responsibility for your life.
              </h3>
              <h3 className="display-7 fw-bold ">
                {" "}
                “Why” questions keep us focused on external things we can’t
                control, such as other people’s actions and motivations. It’s
                much better to ask questions focused on “what”—what you can do,
                what you can control, what you can learn. After all, the only
                thing you can truly control is yourself. The sooner you realize
                it, the better.
              </h3>
              <h3 className="display-7 fw-bold ">
                {" "}
                But to move forward in our lives, it’s necessary that we outgrew
                from this and stop drinking the poison which we think will
                somehow kill the other.
              </h3>
              <h3 className="display-7 fw-bold ">
                {" "}
                When we’re jealous of someone, we begin to think of them in a
                negative light. That’s why jealousy is so insidious. At its
                worst, jealousy is less about wanting someone’s success and more
                about wanting their failure. So, it’s crucial for achieving the
                things we desire that we flip the scenario around and stay
                humble, put ourself in a learning posture, and start making
                discoveries that help on our own journeys.

                We all have our own paths carved in a uniquely beautiful way.
                So, don’t spend your life trying to sing someone else’s tune.
                Trying to copy another person’s success makes about as much
                sense as wishing you had their thumbprint and instead bring out
                your unique gift to light.
              </h3>
              <h3 className="display-7 fw-bold ">
                Jealousy causes us to be inwardly focused. The more we fixate on
                what others have, the more angry, resentful, and bitter we
                become. So, stop focusing on what you don’t have, and start
                focusing on how you can help others. Jealousy is rooted in
                taking. Generosity is rooted in giving. I remember someone once
                said that, “Your influence is determined by how abundantly you
                place other people’s interests first”. And I can’t argue.
              </h3>
              <h3 className="display-7 fw-bold ">
                {" "}
                The only way to defeat jealousy is by taking action. You won’t
                do it by thinking or analysing. You have to do something about
                it.
              </h3>
              <h3 className="display-7 fw-bold ">
                {" "}
                Don’t forget that jealousy is an inner consciousness of one’s
                own inferiority. It is a mental cancer. And the sooner you work
                on to cure it, the better chances you’ll have to live the life
                you’ll remember.
              </h3>
              <h3 className="display-7 fw-bold ">
                {" "}
                So, don’t let it overpower you. And stand up for yourself, it’s
                all going to be worth it in the end. It can look a little messy
                and hard when you start the changing process but believe me on
                that, that it’s going to be absolutely gorgeous in the end.
