                It's perhaps the most painful emotion that you feel and it's the
                worst of all the demons. It's a feeling of remorse for some
                wrong whether real or imagined that you did to someone. But
                holding on to things that have gone wrong in your past is not
                going to serve your future. Because what you are doing is that
                you are letting that moment from your past, the moment that no
                longer exists suck out all the joy out of your present and your
                future. Is it worth it to you? Are you really up for that
                "already over" moment to take away all the joy from your next
                moments?{" "}

                Let it go. We all make mistakes. We all do. But guilt is just a
                useless feeling. It's never enough to make you change your
                direction instead it'll just make you like itself. Maybe there's
                more you could have done at that time to better the
                circumstances but it's over. It's no longer in your grasp to
                change that moment but what you can still do is own it, confront
                it, and learn from it. Don't let it strangle you anymore.
                Because when you are guilty, it is always followed by you
                feeling shame for what you are. And that's where the downfall
                begins because it tears a person in the worst way because where
                guilt would have motivated a confession but the wish to avoid
                the humiliation of shame may just prevent it. So, the best way
                to begin would be by being honest about your feelings and
                realizing that guilt is detrimental to your happiness and just a
                wasted emotion. So, do the right thing and go and apologize.
                Forgive yourself. Make amends and then let go of it. Cause if
                you don't do that now, it will lead you to only one place and
                that is fear. And darling, fear holds back way too much of life.
                So now it's your choice to make, either you can allow guilt to
                hold you back or you can allow it to show you what you need to
                shift in your life in order for you to breathe free again.
                Remember, you are not your past. And start with one day at a
                time. Be kind to yourself.
