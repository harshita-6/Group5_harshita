                … in each individual there is a coherent organization of mental
                processes; and we call this his ego. It is to this ego that
                consciousness is attached; the ego controls the approaches to
                motility… it is the mental agency which supervises all its own
                constituent processes…{" "}

                The way you think, feel, and behave isn’t just a coincidence;
                your choices come from within you, based on your personality,
                your environment, genetics, and those around you. Ego psychology
                deals with the ego, that part of you that makes those decisions.
                Learning more about your ego may increase your ability to make
                choices that benefit you more often.
              </h3>
              <h3 className="display-7 fw-bold ">
                we mostly talk about the Ego in a negative way. If a person has
                a big Ego they are typically somebody who is too big for their
                shoes, too full of themselves. The Ego is the part of us that
                contains our conscious awareness, our thinking and acting, our
                defences. It makes judgements, makes sense of this world,
                processes information, contains reason and common sense. It also
                contains our identity, our understanding of who we are and who
                we want to be in this world. So it's really important to develop
                a strong and healthy Ego so that we know who we are and become
                able to be independent, go out into the world and build a good
                life.
              </h3>
              <h3 className="display-7 fw-bold ">
                If our Ego is too weak, for example because we didn't get enough
                support, love, encouragement or appreciation, we will find life
                difficult. We won't have a good feeling of who we are and what
                we want. We might feel inferior, wounded, angry or depressed and
                might constantly have to deal with inner conflict, guilt and
                self-doubt. It's especially important to help children and
                teenagers to develop a good, strong Ego by mirroring them in a
                positive way: "I think you're really good at this or that; I
                understand what you mean; that's a very interesting thought; you
                are a good child; you are intelligent and beautiful; I'm
                convinced that you can do this!" etc. If we beat them down time
                and again they will not be able to develop a strong sense of
                self and identity.
              </h3>
              <h3 className="display-7 fw-bold ">
                The Ego can cause problems if it is inflated, if we totally
                overestimate our abilities and our importance, if we think that
                we're better and "bigger" than others. An oversized Ego lacks
                substance; it's like a balloon, full of air. But it can cause as
                many problems if it is deflated, too small and weak. Then we
                won't be able to find our feet in this world and create loving,
                warm relationships or to stand up for ourselves. Only a robust
                and resilient Ego can be a good partner to our Inner Self from
                where creativity, intuition and spirituality come.
              </h3>
              <h3 className="display-7 fw-bold ">
                In later life we might find that our standing in the outer world
                is not what matters so much anymore, that we naturally start to
                turn inwards. Then we may feel that to have an opinion about
                everything loses its importance, that status and image aren't
                enough anymore, that we become more interested in insight and
                wisdom. But if we never had an Ego of the right size, if it
                always was too big or too small, life will be difficult, scary
                or empty. So don't be afraid of Ego-strength, of an Ego with
                substance. Without it we can't mature, we can't be strong,
                loving and happy; without it we can't live a good life.
